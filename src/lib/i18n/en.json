      "description": "Projects that use artificial intelligence to reinterpret historical archives, generate new memories, or question our relationship with the past.",
      "intro": "The incorporation of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> into the processes of memory construction has profoundly transformed our relationship with the past. Far from functioning solely as a tool for automation or archiving, AI now acts as an <strong>interpretive agent</strong>, capable of reorganizing, translating, and generating narratives from large volúmenes of historical, visual, sound, and textual data. In this context, memory is no longer understood as a fixed record but as a <strong>dynamic, unstable, and contested process</strong>.",
      "p1": "The <strong>AI & Memory</strong> collection brings together projects that employ algorithmic systems to reinterpret historical archives, activate latent memories, and question the ways in which the past is preserved, narrated, and transmitted. These practices do not seek to replace human memory, but to <strong>challenge it</strong>: they expose its gaps, biases, and silences, while proposing new forms of critical reading of the archive.",
      "p2": "From a conceptual perspective, artificial intelligence functions here as a <strong>cultural mediation technology</strong>. Machine learning models do not 'remember' in the human sense of the term; they operate based on patterns, probabilities, and correlations. However, when trained with historical materials—photographs, documents, testimonies, audiovisual records, and oral tradition—they produce representations that force us to ask <strong>who remembers, what is remembered, and under what criteria collective memory is constructed</strong>.",
      "p3": "These works show that <strong>every archive is political</strong>. The selection of data, digitalization processes, curatorial decisions, and the algorithms themselves respond to specific social and cultural contexts. In this sense, <strong>AI is not neutral</strong>: it amplifies both dominant discourses and structural absences. The collection embraces this tension as a field of critical work, proposing projects that make visible what is omitted, fragmented, and unsaid, and that open space for alternative memories.",

El proyecto surge de una indagación sobre la figura histórica de José García, alias Cosiaca, personaje popular del siglo XIX que encarna la astucia, el humor irreverente y la oralidad como forma de resistencia cultural.",
        "p2": "More than a traditional historiographical reconstruction, Cosiaca 350 proposes memory as an <strong>expanded narrative territory</strong>, where the past is reactivated through strategies of fiction, interaction, and public participation.

        "list_item_1": "<strong>Narrative podcast:</strong> A sound series that fictionalizes historical encounters, mixing documented facts with speculative imagination.

        "list_item_2": "<strong>Interactive web game with AI:</strong> A digital environment where the user dialogues with an artificial version of Cosiaca. This character, built from historical research and linguistic patterns, does not seek to simulate an absolute truth, but to stage the tensions between memory, fiction, and technology.

        "list_item_3": "<strong>Audiovisual pieces for social media:</strong> Micro-stories designed for digital circulation that fragment and redistribute memory in brief formats. These pieces function as cultural dissemination capsules, activating the archive in the present and expanding the narrative to new audiences.",
        "p4": "From the curatorial approach of AI & Memory, Cosiaca 350 exemplifies how artificial intelligence can be used to <strong>reactivate the archive without fetishizing it</strong>, keeping the technological mediation and its limits visible. AI is not presented as a guarantor of authenticity, but as a tool that evidences the narrative construction of all historical memory.",
        "p5": "The project also poses fundamental ethical questions: what does it mean to give an algorithmic voice to a historical character?, how can we avoid the crystallization of cultural stereotypes?, where is the line between homage, reinterpretation, and simulation? In response, Cosiaca 350 bets on <strong>narrative transparency, conscious play, and the user's critical participation</strong>.",
        "p6": "In this sense, the project embodies one of the central principles of the collection: understanding memory not as an act of passive conservation, but as a <strong>living, situated, and constantly rewritten practice</strong>. Cosiaca 350 demuestra que la IA puede ser una aliada para explorar identidades locales, siempre que se asuma como un medio cultural y no como una autoridad histórica."

      "curator": "Manuel Palacio",
      "description": "Works that invite the public to participate, modifying the piece with their presence or actions, exploring new forms of sensory and cognitive experience.",
      "intro": "Interactive art redefines the traditional relationship between <strong>work, spectator, and author</strong> by shifting the aesthetic experience from <strong>passive contemplation</strong> to <strong>active participation</strong>. In this field, the work is not presented as a closed object, but as an open system that is activated, transformed, or completed based on the presence, the body, the decisions, or the actions of the public. Desde esta perspectiva, la percepción deja de ser un proceso meramente visual para convertirse en una <strong>experiencia multisensorial, cognitiva y relacional</strong>. The spectator no longer “observes” the work: they inhabit it, alter it, and co-produce it. Each interaction introduces a variation, causing the work to exist in multiple possible states, always situated in the here and now of the encounter. Interactive art explores how the senses, attention, memory, and movement influence the construction of meaning. Physical interfaces, digital systems, sensors, algorithms, sound, image, and data are articulated to generate dynamic perceptual environments, where the experience emerges from the dialogue between technology and the human body. In this context, the perception is not fixed or universal, but <strong>contingent, subjective, and mutable</strong>. These practices question the boundaries between the material and the immaterial, the analog and the digital, the human and the technological. The work becomes an <strong>experiential device</strong>, closer to a laboratory than a traditional art object. Error, improvisation, and the unexpected response of the system are a constitutive part of the creative process. From a cognitive approach, interactive art highlights that perceiving is also <strong>interpreting, deciding, and acting</strong>. The interaction activates complex mental processes: anticipation, learning, empathy, body awareness, and critical reflection on the technological environment we inhabit. Así, la experiencia estética se expande hacia una experiencia de conocimiento. La colección Arte Interactivo y Percepción reúne obras y proyectos que investigan estas tensiones y posibilidades, proponiendo al público no solo una experiencia sensorial, sino una toma de conciencia sobre su propio rol dentro de los sistemas que atraviesan la vida contemporánea. Aquí, el arte funciona como un espacio de exploración perceptiva, donde la tecnología no es un fin, sino un medio para repensar cómo sentimos, entendemos y construimos el mundo.",
      "sections": {
        "cocreation": {
          "title": "Active Participation and Co-creation",
          "p1": "In interactive art, the spectator ceases to be a passive observer and becomes a user, participant, or even a programmer of the work. Rodrigo Alonso señala que, en sentido amplio, 'toda obra interactiva es participativa' porque requiere necesariamente 'la <strong>colaboración</strong> entre su autor, el dispositivo tecnológico, y un usuario.' That is, the public is part of a creative triangle along with the artist and technology. El usuario's incorporación suele darse a través de dispositivos que reaccionan a sus acciones: como apunta Alonso, 'la forma más básica de hacer consciente al usuario de su participación es introducirlo en la obra mediante algún dispositivo que reaccione directamente a sus actos'. For example, a motion sensor, a microphone, or a camera is enough for the visitor's physical presence to immediately alter what is projected: the mouse arrow that signals our presence on the screen is an elementary case, but interactive installations usually replace it with creative means—images, sound, algorithms—that visualize each user's gesture.",
          "p2": "This activation of the public converts the work into a dialogical process. As Ernest Edmonds and Stroud Cornock señalaron en los años 70, se configura un <strong>'sistema artístico'</strong> dinámico en el cual 'el artista, la audiencia y el objeto […] están involucrados activamente en la creación de la obra.' The meaning of the piece is constructed through this exchange: interaction is the very medium of the creative process, not just a trigger for something to happen. In practice, the user can literally appear within the work (e.g., their silhouette captured in real-time) or be transformed into visual or sound codes. Paradigm works like Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's Pulse Room (2006) make this co-creation evident: by taking each visitor's heart rate, it projects it as a flickering light in the room, so that 'the public's participation becomes essential to complete the work.' In this way, the visitor not only modifies the work by their presence but also literally constitutes its content. In sum, the interactive piece invites the public to collaborate actively in its definition, blurring the boundary between the finished work and the open process of its gestation."
        },
        "experience": {
          "title": "New Sensory and Cognitive Experiences",
          "p1": "Interactive works open up new forms of aesthetic experience, integrating the spectator's senses, body, and thought. At a sensory level, they combine visual, auditory, tactile, and even olfactory stimuli to immerse the user in multi-dimensional environments. Onionlab describe que estas instalaciones 'tienen la capacidad de cambiar la forma en que la gente percebe el arte' al hacerlos partícipes del proceso creativo, generando 'una <strong>experiencia atractiva y personal</strong> que enciende la imaginación.' By simultaneously activating several sensory channels, interactive art produces a state of inmersión where perception is amplified: as Rodrigo Alonso comenta, el color, la imagen, el texto y el sonido se conjugan de modo que la participación del público se convierte 'en una <strong>experiencia a la vez sensorial y conceptual</strong>'.",
          "p2": "The interactive work can also alter our perception of space and time. La convivencia del elemento físico con datos digitales en tiempo real disuelve los límites entre lo real y lo virtual: Alonso subraya que esta interrelación arquitectónica y tecnológica 'induce la reconsideración de los límites entre realidad y artificio', haciendo que los entornos sensibles sean más fluidos y abiertos a lo impredecible. In definitiva, el usuario vive una experiencia multisensorial intensificada: cada acción genera consecuencias inmediatas (cambios de color, de sonido, de forma) que se integran en un continuo de estímulos. Este giro sensorial es la base de nuevas vivencias estéticas donde el acto de percepción ya no es pasivo sino activo y creativo.",
          "p3": "At a cognitive level, interactive works pose new mental challenges. El espectador debe explorar dinámicas no determinísticas, descubrir reglas emergentes y construirse un sentido propio de la pieza. La teórica de interacción Lucy Suchman destaca que en estos sistemas <strong>'la acción es central y las metas son emergentes'</strong>: los usuarios 'alcanzan' el significado de la obra a través de sus propios encuentros con ella. In other words, the value of the installation arises from the user's behavior and decisions in real time. Este proceso se vincula con la idea de arte como conocimiento vivido: la interacción es 'no simplemente un medio para activar la obra, sino un vehículo para la reflexión y la producción de conocimiento'. From this perspective, the artistic system functions as a <strong>“living laboratory”</strong> (similar to the Powerhouse Museum's Beta_space project), where each visitor collaborates with their actions in the generation of meaning. Así, más allá de un goce estético pasivo, el público asume un rol cognitivo activo: pregunta, indaga, espera o reconoce patrones, desarrollando una experiencia intelectual personalizada en cada encuentro con la obra."

          "p1": "In the curatorship of Interactive Art and Perception, various references from practice and theory are supported. En el ámbito artístico, destacan creadores contemporáneos que exploran la interacción y la percepción multisensorial. For example, <strong>Rafael Lozano-Hemmer</strong> (Mexico-Canada) is known for installations that combine biometric sensors with light and sound effects. Su obra <em>Pulse Room</em> (2006) registra los latidos cardiacos de los visitantes y los traduce en un mar de bombillas parpadeantes, de modo que la pulsación vital de cada persona se convierte en elemento visual y sensorial. Grupos como <strong>teamLab</strong> (Japón) han popularizado entornos digitales inmersivos (realidad aumentada/virtual) donde los movimientos del público alteran patrones de proyección sobre las paredes. Del mismo modo, pioneros como <strong>Christa Sommerer & Laurent Mignonneau</strong> (Austria-Francia) han desarrollado desde los 90 instalaciones interactivas basadas en cámaras y sensores (por ejemplo, obras que traducen gestos corporales en formas orgánicas en pantalla). Otros referentes incluyen a <strong>Random International</strong> (UK), con obras como <em>Rain Room</em> (donde caminar bajo lluvia requiere de la presence humana para detener el agua) y artistas generativos como <strong>Camille Utterback</strong> o <strong>Golan Levin</strong>, cuyas obras de software transforman los gestos del usuario en arte visual y sonoro en tiempo real. Aunque no se citen todas exhaustivamente, estos ejemplos ilustran la variedad de aproximaciones: desde instalaciones de gran escala hasta experiencias íntimas, siempre integrando la percepción del público como materia prima.",
          "p2": "On the theoretical level, the collection is based on concepts that link participation, perception, and aesthetics. En primer lugar, la fenomenología de <strong>Maurice Merleau-Ponty</strong> proporciona una visión clave: él considera que la percepción es pre-reflexiva y corporal, de modo que sujeto y objeto se entrelazan «en un entretejido donde objeto y sujeto son interdependientes». Under this perspective, interactive art is explained as an extension of our perceptual body: la obra no es un mero objeto representado, sino que participa de la construcción misma de la experiencia del mundo. In line with this, <strong>Nicolas Bourriaud</strong> –teórico de la estética relacional– define el arte contemporáneo como «organización de presencia compartida entre objetos, imágenes y gente». Para Bourriaud, la obra es un espacio social: el espectador ya no es receptor pasivo, sino agente activo cuya interacción constituye el sentido. In fact, in his perspective, current art serves as a «laboratorio de formas vivas que cualquiera puede apropiar», enfatizando el juego comunitario y la co-interpretación. Desde la teoría de los nuevos medios, figuras como <strong>Edmonds and Cornock</strong> laid academic foundations: en los 70 propusieron el concepto de la “matriz artística”, señalando que en las obras interactivas todos los componentes (artista, público, medio tecnológico) cooperan; la interactividad es entonces el propio proceso creativo. This idea is also taken up in human-computer interaction studies: for example, <strong>Lucy Suchman</strong> enfatiza que en estos entornos «la acción es central y las metas son emergentes», de modo que el significado se construye en cada acción del usuario. Otro investigador, <strong>Söke Dinkla</strong>, vincula el arte interactivo actual con los experimentos participativos de los 60 (happenings, cine expandido), destacando su naturaleza «híbrida»: según ella, pese a la sofisticación técnica, el arte interactivo «no se basa en objetos cuya relevancia sea visual; […] el material artístico está constituido por el diálogo entre el programa y el usuario». Finalmente, estudios recientes (como la tesis sobre entornos sensoriales interactivos de María T. Alonso Acebes) subrayan que estas obras generan experiencias inmersivas, sensoriales e intelectuales, en las que la participación es crucial para crear significado. De este modo, convergen diversas corrientes –fenomenología, estética relacional, arte generativo, interfaz hombre-máquina– que sitúan al espectador en el centro del fenómeno artístico.",
          "p3": "Interactive art is defined as a form of artistic expression that involves the active collaboration of the public in the creation of the work. Según StudySmarter, esta modalidad «permite la participación activa del espectador en el proceso creativo, convirtiéndolo en co-creador de la obra». By means of digital technologies, sensors, and interfaces, interactive art generates dynamic and personalized experiences that directly link the public with the piece. En esta convergencia de arte y tecnología se redefinen los límites de lo tradicional, enfatizándose la importancia de lo sensorial y emocional en la apreciación artística. The 'Interactive Art and Perception' collection in the Núcleo Colectivo project (curated by Manuel Palacio) is based on this principle: la obra ya no es un objeto estático, sino un espacio de encuentro donde el espectador juega un rol central en su significado."

          "title": "Curatorial Conclusions",
          "p1": "El enfoque curatorial de Manuel Palacio para la colección “Arte Interactivo y Percepción” se apoya en estos ejes conceptuales: participación activa, experiencia multisensorial y visión teórica. The selection of works will aim for pieces where the technology involved multiplies the senses (visual, sound, tactile) and encourages conscious public involvement. Siguiendo las fuentes citadas, la curaduría valorará proyectos generativos que integren datos reales o IA, instalaciones inmersivas que involucren el cuerpo en el espacio y estructuras abiertas de significado. In this context, the curator acts more as a facilitator of creative encounters than as a sole author: he is inspired by the idea of the museum as a “living laboratory” where interaction enriches both the visitor and the art itself.",
          "p2": "In sum, the proposed curatorial basis considera que el arte interactivo transforma la función del espectador, disolviendo las barreras entre lo visible y lo vivido. By turning the aesthetic experience into a participatory process, an emotional and intellectual bond is built with the work, giving rise to new forms of artistic understanding. Estas perspectivas teóricas y prácticas sustentan la colección, garantizando que “Arte Interactivo y Percepción” se configure como un corpus coherente de obras que despliegan activamente la percepción del público y redefinen la experiencia estética en la era digital."

          "text": "En el arte interactivo la percepción es un acto corporal y situado. Según la fenomenología de Merleau-Ponty, el cuerpo vivido es el medio de toda experiencia sensorial. In this framework, the interactive work extends the spectator's body into the artistic space, induciendo a que “sujeto y objeto se mezclen y coexistan” en un entretejido de sentido. This means that art is not limited to representing the world, but actively participates in its perceptual construction."

Interactive art uses interfaces (sensors, cameras, touch screens, mobile devices, etc.) for the piece to respond to the public's gestures, sounds, or movements. No son obras estáticas; deben mutar en función del usuario y su entorno. A 'dialogue between the work and the spectator' is established, haciendo que cada visita sea irrepetible. In this sense, la interacción redefine la experiencia estética en forma de intercambio vivo."

          "text": "Se refiere a prácticas algorítmicas autónomas. Generative art is created through computational systems that operate (semi)autónomamente, reduciendo la intervención manual del artista. In essence, the creator defines rules and parameters, mientras que the system genera de forma impredecible formas, imágenes o sonidos. This symbiosis means the final result emerges from human-machine collaboration. Many generative works incorporate real-time data and sensors, so the public can modify variables through gestures, voice, or movement. Así, lo generativo empuja la interactividad hacia la aleatoriedad guiada: por ejemplo, un algoritmo puede cambiar un paisaje sonoro según la posición de los visitantes, produciendo un flujo sensorial nuevo en cada iteración."

Como explica Rodrigo Alonso, estas obras “ponen en interrelación un espacio físico –habitado por los cuerpos y las acciones de los usuarios– con un conjunto de datos, operaciones y traducciones numéricas que modifican el entorno sensible”. That is, they combine the material (pavement, walls, objects) with the digital (projections, live data) to create a coherent environment. El usuario se desplaza en él como parte de la obra, reformulando su percepción espacial y temporal."

The use of digital technology –ordenadores, sensores biométricos, cámaras de captura de movimiento, realidad virtual/aumentada, inteligencia artificial, etc.– is essential in interactive art. Gracias a estos recursos, el artista designs sistemas en que los datos del entorno o del cuerpo influyen continuamente en la obra. For example, 3D cameras can map the public's shape to generate volumetric images, mientras que algoritmos de IA pueden reinterpretar las entradas del usuario creando nuevos efectos sonoros o visuales. In a word, technology acts as a mediator between the spectator and the work, amplificando los estímulos sensoriales y ofreciendo múltiples niveles de interacción (local o incluso colectiva en línea)."

Como apunta Onionlab, al permitir la interacción el arte deviene «una conversación animada entre la visión del artista y la interpretación del observador, disolviendo las líneas que distinguen el arte de la realidad». The result is a personal and memorable experience: cada usuario construye significados propios. La interacción «enciende la imaginación» del espectador, creando un lazo emocional y cognitivo con la obra. Así, la dimensión estética reside menos en la contemplación distante y más en el vínculo activo; el arte se vivencia como un evento único donde el sentido se co-genera entre todos los participantes."
